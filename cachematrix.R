## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## Function to inverse matrix but also checks cache for previous matrix inversion
## CacheSolve returns the inverse of a function 


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ix<-solve(x)
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        ix
}
